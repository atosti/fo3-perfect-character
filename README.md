# Theory

For years I've wanted to create the "perfect" character in Fallout 3 as quickly as possible. However, many of the guides on this matter are either extremely dated, inaccurate, or both. As such, I started crafting my own route which I've detailed here.

There are a few karma choices I make in the route (such as killing Harold, or enslaving Arkansas) due to their rewards, but for the most part I leave karma decisions up to the player. Any that I do make have limited impact on the overall game world.

I understand there are speedrunning strategies (such as Speedcripple), which would make the route faster. However, my goal here is to play a relatively normal game. I don't try to break the engine or use speed modifying glitches. It's a route that any player should be able to pick up and easily complete without learning some difficult tech.

## What is meant by "perfect"?

This guide achieves a character with 100 in all skills, 10 in all SPECIAL stats and prioritizes all Damage increases, Damage Reduction, and VATS improvement perks. To achieve this, the Broken Steel DLC is required. Moreover, 2 of the perks I pick don't perfectly fit this mold: Strong Back and Silent Running. If you want to swap these two out for something else, go ahead, but I explain my reasoning for them later on in this guide.

### Skillpoint Breakdown
1. There are 13 skills in Fallout 3, raising them each to level 100 requires a total of **1300 points**.
2. At level 30 (with the bobbleheads) we'll have 10 in each SPECIAL stat. This gives an initial value of 27 to all your skills, totaling **351 points**.
3. All characters get 3 initially tagged skills, totaling **45 points**.
4. Having 10 intelligence grants 20 points per level-up (for 29 levels) totaling **580 points**.
5. The skill bobbleheads each provide +10 to their skill, or **130 points** in total.
    * Note that in my route, I do something tricky: I ignore the Energy Weapons bobblehead in Raven Rock, since the Cyborg perk adds +10 to energy weapons.
6. Yew's bear charm (an award for the Oasis quest) grants a permanent **10 points** to speech.

Overall, this means we're getting **1116 points** without ever touching a book. Using the Comprehension perk (to get +2pts per book) means that only **92** books need to be acquired to reach maximum level. This, combined with the fact that both Big Guns and Science books are infinitely respawning, means that maxing your skills is actually pretty easy.

### Quest Perks
There are a handful of quest perks that make your character stronger. They're Ant Sight/Might, Barkskin, Rad Regeneration, Survival Guru, and Wired Reflexes. In total, these all come from 4 quests, so those are included in the route.

# The Route
I've divided the route into rough level-estimates (based on a Normal Difficulty playthrough), but being a game with many RNG mechanics it's likely you won't match it perfectly. This is fine and unlikely to cause issues, just aim to follow the route in order. If you really want to match it perfectly and happen to fall behind, try lockpicking some extra containers for bonus EXP.

There are really only a few rules follow for success:
1. Follow the route and its order of events.
2. Loot all stimpacks and frag grenades/mines that you can easily get and save the latter for the Fairfax farm. They make the route easier and faster.
3. Wait until you get the Comprehension perk to read any books. After that, read them as soon as you get them.
5. Holster your weapon when running long distances, you'll move faster.
6. Pick Snide answers (always the bottom choice) when returning to Moira for her quest steps. This will ensure you receive the perk that buffs your Critical Chance.

## Character Build
### SPECIAL
**ST = 5, PE = 6, EN = 6, C = 1, I = 10, A = 6, L = 6**

Most of these are selected for Perk requirements, and 10 Intelligence is chosen to earn the maximum skillpoints per level-up.

### Tagged Skills
**Explosives, Lockpick, Small Guns**

1. Explosives of 50 is required for Demolition Expert, which is an early perk and required for EXP farming later on.
2. Level 50 lockpicking is needed almost immediately, so tagging it allows that to be easily achieved.
3. Early game revolves around the 10mm pistol and other small guns, so this makes initial leveling easier and more consistent.

    * Back in the real world talk to your Dad and tell him you won't be joining him at Rivet City.

    * Go outside her shop and cripple yourself with the help of a grenade. Or two.

    * Also, grab the Intelligence Bobblehead on one of the lab tables. It doesn't do anything for us, but it's a nice trinket.
5. Travel to the Jefferson Memorial
    * Wait 1 hour in-game to let the scientists arrive. Talk to your dad and agree to clear the inside.

    * Now enter the Children's Wing of the library. On the bookshelf immediately in front of you is the Small Guns book.
    * Drop down to the bottom floor with the raiders and find the cafeteria section to the south. The Speech book is on the counter here.

    * Kill all the guardians inside this zone and then grab the Science book next to Lesko's PC. It's in the same room as the Ant Queen.
    * Return to Lesko, tell him your work is done and then ask him for your injection. It doesn't matter which you pick, but I'd suggest Ant Might for the increased weight capacity. It also makes some math easier later on in the build.
    * Go Northeast of Lesko's lab and find the maintenance closet with the spinning emergency light on above it. Lockpick it open, then use Grady's key to get the Naughty Nightwear from the safe. Kill Lug-Nut when he harasses you about it.

    * Talk to Harold and agree to kill him.
    * Before going to the caves, find Sapling Yew (she's the kid) and ask her about Harold, then pass her speech check to learn his fear. To make this easier, save scum while wearing the naughty nightwear, lucky shades, and eulogy's hat.
    * Now go to the Southwest to reach the cave entrance. Listen to Birch and Laurel talk, or quicksave/quickload to skip it. They'll each give you a sap.
    * Talk to Branchtender Cypress behind them and ask for the gate key. Then enter the caves.

    * Now find Sapling Yew and she'll gift you the bear charm. This permanently buffs your Speech by 10 points. You can sell it afterwards, it doesn't need to stay in your inventory.

    * Go to the brothel and kill Madame for her key. Unlock the cell with a single raider and find the Energy Weapons book on a bunk bed inside.
3. Travel to the Dunwich Building
    * Core Loot: Repair book and the Melee Weapons Bobblehead
    * Enter and loot the grenade box immediately in front of you. Also grab the stimpacks to your left in the Eatotronic.
    * Make your way to the Forsaken Ruins. Find the maintenance closet off the South hallway, the Repair book is next to the toolbox on the shelf.
    * Proceed to the Virulent Underchambers. After dropping down, make your way back up through the maintenance corridors to find the Melee Weapons bobblehead. The room with Jaime can be ignored.
4. Travel to the Super-Duper Mart
    * Walk across the bridge to the North, then head straight East to the National Guard Depot.
    * Kill any enemies along the way.

## TBD - Next Steps
Next Steps:
1. Get the remaining skill bobbleheads: Small Guns, Lockpick (National Guard Depot + Bethesda Ruins)
2. Return to Moira for the last chapter on RobCo.
    - Presently at 42, so I need 4 books (50) to complete the optional objective.
        * Library = 1
        * Grayditch = 1
        * Bethesda Ruins = 1
        * RobCo itself = 1
3. Now all quests are complete.
4. Setup the farms at Bethesda and the Fairfax ruins.
5. Start farming for roughly 20 levels. Determine avg. EXP/run to estimate number of required runs.
6. Figure out how to spend skillpoints and what your level 30 stats should look like prior to acquiring Almost Perfect.
7. Now find the
8. ALTERNATELY. You can discover these final locations ahead of time, or even account for the books in them to prevent how much Shalebridge/Bethesda must be farmed.

# Skillbook and Experience Farming
In Fallout 3, many enemies respawn every 3 in-game days. By using the wait mechanic to let 72 hours pass, many of the world's locations will have their enemies reset. Moreover, many enemies that spawn out in the open world of the Capitol Wasteland will respawn at the location of their dead body rather than where they were initially found. As such, locations can be initially cleared and rearranged to allow for more optimal subsequent farming. Just be sure to use a weapon that leaves behind a draggable body (e.g. avoid gooing enemies with Energy Weapons).

One more note on the matter. I've read a few (very dated) posts online that mention placing more than 6 enemies of a single type (e.g. 7 raiders) in an area can cause some bodies to disappear from the game forever. While I can't confirm that limiting your bodycount to 6 will prevent this, I have encountered bodies disappearing in some of my saves when using large quantities. If it happens to you, consider limiting each enemy type to a maximum of 6 per area to prevent this. (So 6 raiders and 3 enclave soldiers is fine, but 7 raiders isn't.)

## Preparing the Locations

### Shalebridge
There's no preparations to be made here, the dead Ant Researcher spawns in the back of the tiny ants' tunnel and has a Science skillbook on him each time. Sometimes his body does get stuck at the bottom of the water, though, so be sure to splash around in the water until he floats to the top.

### Bethesda Ruins
This location is home to numerous raiders, which can become a chore to clear each time you visit. Since the raider with the Big Guns skillbook respawns in the West ruins, I advise luring most of the exterior enemies inside the East Ruins and then killing them there. As such, they'll respawn inside that building and won't bother you.

Also, be sure not to attract the ghouls from the Bethesda Underworks above ground, or you'll have a Raider vs. Ghoul war each time you visit. Unless, of course, that's something you want.

### Fairfax Ruins
This is the most important farm to setup and is mandatory for quick experience farming during the mid to late levels. It's home to a ton of raiders and once The Waters of Life quest is complete, the enclave will setup camps to the North and East of the ruins. Simply kill these groups and drag their bodies into the pitfall trap near the metro station entrance. Every three days you'll have a pit full of enemies which you can toss a few grenades into to get a few hundred experience points.

**Pro tip**: Lure the enemies toward the pitfall trap and kill them nearby. If they're too far away, dragging all the bodies into the pit can be very tedious.

## Why 10 Intelligence?
Classic wisdom suggests selecting 9 intelligence and then getting 10 with Rivet City's bobblehead, but I ignore this. By taking 10 intelligence from the start, I can complete everything at Rivet City all at once. This means I can clear the Jefferson Memorial on the way to Rivet City, avoid waiting for the Rivet City bridge to extend (because your dad will activate it when he arrives) and means I only ever need to enter the Science Lab once to talk with both your dad AND Dr. Zimmer. Moreover, I don't have to immediately go out of my way to Rivet City at the start of a run and can get some of the waypoints on the route accomplished by doing other tasks.

Additionally, the SPECIAL point isn't better spent anywhere else. Since at level 30 your character will have 10 in all their SPECIAL stats (and we calculate around this number rather than your initial stats), putting points into them earlier doesn't actually reduce the number of books you need to farm. Aside from perk requirements and the skillpoint gain from Intelligence, your SPECIAL stats really don't matter.

## Why Strong Back and Silent Running?
First and foremost, there aren't many other perks that make you directly more powerful for these two perk slots, so they're more flexible. While arguments could be made for many other perks, such as Quantum Chemist providing a permanent AP boost in the form of infinite cola, or Nerd Rage situationally improving DR, I selected perks that would consistently assist the player in a significant way. My reasoning for each one is listed below.

### Strong Back

By increasing your carry weight by 50, this allows you to carry power armor for free. I consider this similar to a Damage Reduction upgrade, but I understand that it's largely a quality of life improvement. That being said, it's a big quality of life improvement, and helps during both the mid and late game.

### Silent Running

The +10 sneak is a nice bonus, but that's not why it's taken. By allowing the player to sneak while running, they can more easily (and quickly) perform sneak attack criticals, which amounts to an overall increase in average damage output. If you decide to swap this out for something else, just be sure to account for the +10 sneak points it provides in some other way.

## Skipped Perks

### Admantium Skeleton

This only affects how often limbs are crippled rather than reducing raw damage. As such, it only affects the frequency of stimpack use which has a very minor impact on gameplay, so I opt for something more significant.

### Nerd Rage

Damage reduction is permanently capped at 85 for all characters, so the +50 you get from this is rarely getting full value. Additionally, the 10 strength buff is irrelevant when you're max level. Add on the fact that this only ever triggers at 20% or less HP and you get a very situational, weak perk.

### Nerves of Steel

While AP regeneration sounds good, the amount gained by this is so low that it's negligible. In fact, many players initially thought the perk was broken in the vanilla game because of how weak it is. Besides, since the build already uses Grim Reaper's Sprint, you'll be at full AP for many encounters in the late-game anyway.

### Rad Resistance

While this is a straight upgrade to your character, radiation resistance has limited use and is easily mitigated via Rad-X and Rad-Away. Considering the limited amount of perks you get to choose, I opt for something more impactful.

## What About the Energy Weapons Bobblehead?
My route skips Raven Rock due to the time investment required to reach it. As such, the Energy Weapons bobblehead is skipped. I account for this loss in +10 Energy Weapons through the Cyborg perk which provides the same skill bonus (in addition to damage reduction).
